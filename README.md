## Sensor Data Analysis and Roughness Prediction

This project involves the analysis of sensor data and the prediction of roughness in a manufacturing process.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze sensor data collected during a manufacturing process and develop a predictive model for roughness. Roughness is an important quality metric in manufacturing, and predicting it accurately can help optimize the process.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, google-colab (if running in Google Colab)
